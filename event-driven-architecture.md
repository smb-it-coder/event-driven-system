Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern where applications communicate by producing, detecting, and consuming events (notifications of state changes, like "item added to cart") through decoupled services, often via an event broker, enabling real-time responsiveness, scalability, and loose coupling for modern, distributed systems like microservices. Key components are producers (generate events), consumers (react to events), and the event channel (broker/router) that moves them, allowing services to work independently and update states asynchronously.
